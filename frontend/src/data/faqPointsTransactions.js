        question: "I forgot to scan my QR code at checkout. Can I still get my points?",
        answer: "We unfortunately do not have the capacity to retroactively award points for missed scans. In the future, please ensure you scan your QR code before completing your purchase."
    },
    {
        question: "I scanned my QR code, but my points from a recent purchase are missing. Why?",
        answer: "As a safeguard against cashiers artifically inflating people's points balance, if the cashier who served you is flagged as 'suspicious' by the system, the points for that transaction will be pending until a Manager approves it. If the points do not appear after 24 hours, please contact support."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I use my points for a discount?",
        answer: "From your dashboard, you can initiate a 'Redemption' request for the number of points you wish to use. This creates a redemption transaction. Show the transaction ID to a Cashier, and they will process it to apply the discount to your purchase."
    },
    {
        question: "I see an incorrect transaction. What should I do?",
        answer: "If you find an error in your transaction history, please contact a Manager. They have the authority to make adjustments and correct any discrepancies."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I transfer points to another user?",
        answer: "As long as your account is verified, you can go to the 'Transfer' page and enter the recipient's UTORid and the amount of points you wish to send. The transfer is instant."
    },
    {
        question: "What is an adjustment?",
        answer: "An adjustment is a change made to a transaction after it has been processed. This can include correcting errors, applying discounts, or resolving disputes. Adjustments can only be made by staff members with the appropriate permissions. If you have any further questions about adjustments, please contact support."
