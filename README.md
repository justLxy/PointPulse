# PointPulse Loyalty Program

## Overview

PointPulse is a user-friendly loyalty rewards platform that lets users earn, redeem, and transfer points through everyday activities like purchases, events, and promotions. Designed with both users and administrators in mind, it offers easy-to-navigate interfaces for different roles such as Regular Users, Cashiers, Managers, Event Organizers, and Superusers.
